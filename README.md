# Cooking Oil Temperature Detector
This wearable temperature detector is designed to measure oil temperature during cooking. For example, controlling the oil temperature is crucial when frying a steak. By positioning the sensor near the pan, it provides real-time feedback on the oil temperature. When temperature reaches ~180°C, LED lights on to remind it’s time to put the steak in.
